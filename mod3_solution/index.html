					<h3 id="chicken">Chicken</h3>
					<p>The chicken is the world’s most numerous domesticated bird, with over 52 billion farmed worldwide in 2008,rivaling the dog as the most ubiquitous domestic animal globally.These birds have fascinated scholars andresearchers since the dawn of Western civilization, and recent studies are beginning to reveal the depths of their complexity and cognitive ability. According to Andrew F. Fraser, professor of veterinary surgery at Memorial University of Newfoundland, and Donald M. Broom, professor of animal welfare at University of Cambridge:“Those who have studied the behaviour of the domestic fowl in detail…, especially those who have looked atferal fowl…, inevitably acquire much respect for the members of this species.”The chicken is the world’s most numerous domesticated bird, with over 52 billion farmed worldwide in 2008,rivaling the dog as the most ubiquitous domestic animal globally.These birds have fascinated scholars andresearchers since the dawn of Western civilization, and recent studies are beginning to reveal the depths of their complexity and cognitive ability.

					<h3 id="beef">Beef</h3>
					<p>Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle (Bos taurus).In prehistoric times, humankind hunted aurochs and later domesticated them. Since that time, numerous breeds of cattle have been bred specifically for the quality or quantity of their meat. Today, beef is the third most widely consumed meat in the world, after pork and poultry. As of 2018, the United States, Brazil, and China were the largest producers of beef.Beef can be prepared in various ways; cuts are often used for steak, which can be cooked to varying degrees of doneness, while trimmings are often ground or minced, as found in most hamburgers. Beef contains protein, iron, and vitamin B12. Along with other kinds of red meat, high consumption is associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer and coronary heart disease, especially when processed. Beef has a high environmental impact, being a primary driver of deforestation with the highest greenhouse gas emissions of any agricultural product.

					<h3 id="sushi">Sushi</h3>
					<p>Sushi is a Japanese dish featuring specially prepared rice and usually some type of fish or seafood, often raw, but sometimes cooked. And though you might automatically associate the word sushi with raw fish, it's actually the rice that is the most important ingredient. Indeed, the word "sushi" refers to the sour flavor of the vinegared rice. Regardless of the toppings or fillings, sushi always includes rice.As a matter of fact, sushi rice is so important that sushi chefs in Japan undergo years of training just to learn how to cook the rice properly, before they ever begin to handle any fish or seafood. Keeping in mind that all sushi is made with rice, but there are really only two main types of sushi—nigiri and maki. Nigiri sushi is comprised of an oval-shaped mound of rice with a slice of fish or seafood on top. The fish or seafood is usually raw, but sometimes it's fermented and occasionally, such as with eel or shrimp, it's cooked.The word nigiri in Japanese translates approximately to "grip" in English. Thus the Japanese word nigiri-zushi translates roughly as "hand-pressed" sushi. The point is that with nigiri sushi, the rice is molded by hand and the fish or other topping pressed by hand atop the rice. Sometimes the chef will include a bit of wasabi between the fish and rice. The stickiness of the rice, along with the moisture from the topping, helps to adhere the strip of raw fish to the mound of rice underneath.
